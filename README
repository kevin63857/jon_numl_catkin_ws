This is mostly valkyrie mirroring code, last time i checked, you need to install openni2 and NiTE2
openni2 is easily done with apt-get
NiTE2 is not
look at the files in installStuff to install the NiTE stuff



oh yeah, and this is dependent on ALL the valkyrie IHMC code, nasa code and numl code

oh and of course ros and catkin tools

and SFML
